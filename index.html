Here are a few things I'd like to learn from SWEN 101:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How to go about the Software Development Cycle</li>
	<li>How to talk to the customer about project requirements</li>
	<li>What to do if the customer suddenly changes project requirements</li>
	<li>More html projects maybe?</li>
</ul>
